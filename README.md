**Research Experience**
**Deepfake Detection Using Multimodal Neurosymbolic Frameworks**
Under Prof. Fatma Najar – John Jay College of Criminal Justice
Jan 2025 – Present

Exploring multimodal deepfake detection combining audio, video, emotion, and symbolic reasoning.
Utilizing PyTorch, MediaPipe, OpenFace, and face-rPPG to identify inconsistencies in facial motion, tone, and gaze.
Contributing to the development of a neurosymbolic model to improve explainability and generalization across datasets like DFDC, FaceForensics++, and WLD.
Preparing manuscript for submission to PRISM Undergraduate Research Symposium.

**Offensive Language Detection in Online Text**
Under Prof. Vivek Sharma – John Jay College of Criminal Justice
Oct 2024 – May 2025

Compared classical NLP models (e.g., Hate2Vec, BiGRU+GloVe) with LLMs like GPT and LLaMA for detecting hate and abuse.
Built and evaluated classifiers using scikit-learn, Hugging Face, and Google Colab.
Focused on bias mitigation, dataset ethics, and explainable prediction methods.
Contributed to annotated dataset and visualization dashboard for class imbalance analysis.

**Security Culture in the Workplace: Beyond Compliance**
Under Dr. Mohammad Nizamuddin – Bronx Community College (CUNY)
Feb 2024 – May 2024

Investigated organizational security culture through interviews, surveys, and literature on human-centric cybersecurity.
Analyzed factors beyond traditional compliance, such as employee behavior, attitudes, and training.
Produced final report recommending behavioral policy interventions and awareness strategies.
Presented findings at BCC's Undergraduate Research Showcase.
